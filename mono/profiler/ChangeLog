2009-03-23  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Removed useless "gc-signal" option (the
	newer "heap=<SIGNAL>" format of the "heap" option does the same thing).

2009-03-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: When checking if an elf file is valid,
	avoid mapping it in memory until we know it's usable (avoids virtual
	memory fragmentation issues).

2009-01-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Bug fixing.
	The issue is that while reading /proc/self/maps is can happen that
	the last regions (typically [vsyscall] and [vsdo]) are reported more
	than once (or anyway are read more than once, even when usng the plain
	"read" call with no buffering), and I found no workaround for this.
	So the code must be careful and throw away the duplicates.
	- restore_old_regions: work starting from the new regions instead of
	the old ones.
	- sort_regions: introduce a "throw away the duplicates" pass.
	- fix_region_references: added a pass to make sure that the elf files
	always reference the new regions and not the old ones.
	- refresh_memory_regions: call "sort_regions" before
	"restore_old_regions" so we know we have no duplicates.

2009-01-18  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Bug fixing.
	- profiler_executable_memory_region_destroy: fixed a cut&paste mistake
	causing a double free.
	- executable_file_open: allow the code to look at all files, and fix
	building of "files->new_files" list.
	- executable_file_free: set "file->section_regions" to NULL when
	freeing it (for safety).

2008-12-31  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: added "save-allocation-caller" option.

2008-12-30  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	- profiler_executable_memory_region_destroy: fixed memory region
	unloading.
	- executable_file_add_region_reference: likewise.
	- executable_file_close: likewise.
	- executable_file_open: fixed file name handling.
	- parse_map_line: likewise.
	- scan_process_regions: likewise.
	- statistical_call_chain: exit loop if the writer thread is busy.

2008-12-11  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	- executable_file_open: Proper remember of already opened files.
	- ProfilerStatisticalData: use unsigned values so the index never
	trips over and becomes negative.
	- statistical_call_chain, statistical_hit: likewise.

2008-12-11  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added defaults to command line options.

2008-12-01  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	- ProfilerThreadStack: added "last_written_frame" and "written_frames"
	fields to keep track of the call stacks actually written, so that we
	can "replay" the full call stack at the beginning of each event block
	(which allows the decoder to read blocks in random order and still see
	all the call stacks correctly).
	- gc_event: Fixed event creation sequence.
	- Improved event logging (debugging) code.

2008-11-04  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	Make sure that stack sections can be fully reconstructed even reading
	only one block.

2008-10-10  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	Added "aci" option to emit the object "id" at each allocation. 

2008-10-10  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	Added support for handling the stack trace of each allocation event.
	- MonoProfilerDirectives: added directive to state that allocations
	have stack traces (not strictly needed, but simplifirs the decoder).
	- ProfilerEventData: gave one more bit to code (and one less to value).
	- MonoProfilerEvents: Added "stack section" event to record stack state.
	- ProfilerThreadStack: added last_saved_top to track what we just saved.
	- _MonoProfiler::action_flags: Added save_allocation_caller and
	save_allocation_stack to state what we do for allocations.
	- All "thread_stack_..." functions: Track last_saved_top.
	- Added thread_stack_count_unsaved_frames utilty function.
	- write_directives_block: handle ALLOCATIONS_HAVE_STACK directive.
	- Added write_stack_section_event function.
	- write_event: also handle emission of stack sections.
	- Reworked all the "STORE_EVENT_..." macros to work on arbitrary event
	slots (needed for stack sections), and as a consequence fixed all the
	functions that use them.
	- object_allocated: save "delta" stack section if needed.
	- setup_user_options: handle new "sas" option.

2008-09-08  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* Makefile.am: Don't build the profilers if DISABLE_PROFILER is set.

2008-09-08  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	- setup_user_options: made so that the user has to explicitly request
	the "f" mode when the "h" is asked, otherwise the number of snapshot
	blocks in the file is very confusing.
	- Added three icalls to control the profiler from the profiled
	application.

2008-08-28  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* mono-profiler-logging.c (detect_fast_timer): Add missing return type.

2008-08-21  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added support for correct accounting of
	allocations which happened at JIT time.

2008-08-20  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added directives block, and used it to
	state that "allocation attribution" done using the stack tracking (so
	that allocation callers are directly written in the log file).

2008-07-28  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added stack tracking (even if still unused).

2008-07-28  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix bug 412473:
	- write_statistical_data_block: check if the current MonoThread still
	exists, and if not avoid calling mono_jit_info_table_find.
	- profiler_shutdown: flush everything in the current thread.

2008-07-28  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix the "allocation summaries" feature
	(I committed it but it never really worked until now).

2008-07-04  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Emit full type names for loaded classes
	(patch by Rodrigo Kumpera).

2008-07-04  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Use the new "runtime initialized" hook.

2008-07-04  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix an embarassingly stupid problem with
	buffer sizes.

2008-07-03  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Changed the way to wait for the writer
	thread to avoid passing an invalid handle to pthread_join.

2008-06-28  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: When offloading flushing to the writer
	thread, first check that it still exists.

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Offload more flushing to the writer thread,
	and fix the shutdown sequence.

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Made so that at appdomain unload the
	buffers are flushed by the profiler worker thread (which we know
	is registered with the runtime).

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added more logging code.

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Record also the domain of each statistical
	hit, so that mono_jit_info_table_find works properly.

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fixed breakage introduced in r105966

2008-06-17  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Implemented signal based enable-disable
	toggling for the statistical and enter-exit events.

2008-06-17  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c (write_statistical_hit): Use the proper
	domain instead of trying to get one.

2008-06-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c (module_end_load, assembly_end_load):
	Properly check the return value of "mono_assembly_fill_assembly_name",
	otherwise "mono_stringify_assembly_name" can crash.

2008-06-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix a segfault on shutdown (see Marek's
	fix for the default profiler in r105466, the problem is the same.

2008-06-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Initial implementation of summary report
	for allocations at each collection.

2008-05-23  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix warnings x86 and remove debugging code.

2008-05-23  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix the build on x86.

2008-05-23  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Support call chains (backtrace) in the
	stat profiler.

2008-05-12  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c (handle_heap_profiling): Flush all data
	buffers, so that objext allocation events are written before the heap
	description (which contains the "object free" events).

2008-05-12  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added support for a global counter of all
	garbage collections, so that the file decoder can correlate the
	events properly.

2008-05-12  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fixed a bug that prevented using rdtsc,
	and enabled rdtsc by default,adding a command line option to revert
	to using gettimeofday.

2008-05-02  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-logging.c: Turned DEBUG_STATISTICAL_PROFILER off...

2008-05-02  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-logging.c : Rework statistical profiler, adding the
	 ability to scan symbol tables in elf files instead of using dladdr
	 (dladdr skips lots of symbols which this way we get correctly).

2008-04-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-logging.c (gc_event): Fix deadlock condition.

2008-04-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-logging.c (write_current_block): Added an incremental
	 "counter delta" field to the block header, so that each block has a
	 timestamp directly in the header.
	 This will allow tools to know when a block has been emitted without
	 decoding (even without reading) the block contents.
	 So, if the user is only interested in blocks emitted in a certain
	 time interval, the tool can seek into the file instead of reading the
	 block contents.
	 Of course this breaks the file format, but at this stage we can still
	 do it, and... better now than later.

2008-04-10  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c (profiler_heap_scan): removed debugging code
	and therefore removed unconditional inclusion of signal.h (it is now
	included anyway on Unix platforms).

2008-04-10  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added possibiliy of requesting heap
	snapshots with a signal (like heap-shot).

2008-04-02  Rodrigo Kumpera <rkumpera@novell.com>

	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix the arm build. G_BREAKPOINT() does
	a "raise(SIGTRAL)" and in some platforms <signal.h> must be included.

2008-03-28  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added option to append a suffix to the
	default file name.

2008-03-27  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: setup_user_options: set default log file
	name to the name of the executed application.

2008-03-26  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* Makefile.am: enabled the logging profiler on Linux.

2008-03-26  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Attach and detach the writer thread.

2008-03-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fixed bug with memory region indexes.

2008-03-18  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	OPEN_FILE(): Fixed file creation.
	[UN]LOCK_PROFILER(): Removed logging message.

2008-03-11  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fixed heap profiler, added a new way to
	get the symbol names for unmanaged functions, and fixed lots of bugs.

2008-01-08  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: First code drop of new logging profiler
	(and shamefully forgot to set HAS_OPROFILE to 0...).
	* Makefile.am: Added logging profiler, but commented in out to avoid
	breaking the build on Windows.

2005-07-25  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* mono-cov.c: Applied patch from Iain McCoy (iain@mccoy.id.au). Fixes
	#75619.

2003-11-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* mono-cov.c: Change default assembly name to mscorlib.dll
	
Tue Jul 1 11:26:10 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: added.

Mon Jun 16 18:21:26 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* mono-cov.c: coverage profiler.
