    <remarks>
      <para>
      Initially ported from JUnit, the current version, 2.0 is the second major release of this xUnit based unit testing tool for 
      NET. It is written entirely in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage of many .NET language features, 
      for example custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities. NUnit brings xUnit to all .NET languages.
