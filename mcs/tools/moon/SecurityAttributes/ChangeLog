	* merge.cs: Smarter merge to avoid duplicate (or unneeded) attributes
	on methods when a type is decorated with SC or SSC.

	* merge.cs: Avoid duplicates in the merged files (e.g. an SC from
	both compatibility and automatic).

	* detect-sc.cs, detect-ssc.cs: Accept multiple input directories
	to find the platform assemblies (and deal with the current /mcs
	and /moon locations).
	* Makefile.am: Detect platform assemblies in {x}/mcs and {x}/moon

	* detect-sc.cs: Tool to detect methods that *likely* needs a
	[SecurityCritical] attribute to execute under the CoreCLR
	* detect-ssc.cs: Tool to detect methods that *likely* needs a
	[SecuritySafeCritical] attribute to execute under the CoreCLR
	* find-sc.cs: Tool to extract types and methods decorated with
	[SecurityCritical] in Silverlight platform code.
	* merge.cs: Tool to merge the different data files into files (one
	per assembly) usable by the tuner.
	* PlatformCode.cs: Helpers for tools.
	* CecilRocks.cs: Extension methods helpers for tools.
	* Makefile: Build file. Normally only the merging should be done.
	Other options needs "supervision" ;-) and store their data into 
	SVN to allow tracking/auditing all changes. Note: this is not (yet)
	part of the main build.
	* README: Documentation about the files.
