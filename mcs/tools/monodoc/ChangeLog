	* Monodoc/xhtml-provider.cs: Use HelpSource.Message(), not 
	  Console.WriteLine().

2008-10-28  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Monodoc/provider.cs: Add HelpSource.InlineCss and
	  HelpSource.InlineJavaScript virtual properties, so that the help
	  source can provide specific CSS and JavaScript to be included into
	  the generated HTML document.  This is used by the ASP.NET front-end,
	  as it needs to insert the CSS & JavaScript separately (as it also
	  inserts its own CSS & JavaScript).
	* Monodoc/ecma-provider.cs, Monodoc/ecmaspec-provider.cs,
	  Monodoc/error-provider.cs: Override InlineCss & InlineJavaScript, as
	  appropriate.

2008-10-24  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Monodoc/addins-provider.cs, Monodoc/ecma-provider.cs,
	  Monodoc/ecmaspec-provider.cs, Monodoc/error-provider.cs,
	  Monodoc/man-provider.cs, Monodoc/monohb-provider.cs,
	  Monodoc/provider.cs: Remove Console.WriteLine() spew; helps cleanup
	  `make` output in mcs/docs (from `mdoc assemble`, which indirectly
	  invokes most of the *-provider files).  We solve this problem by
	  providing a TraceLevel-based message system, so that messages are
	  only generated if they are less than or equal to the requested
	  output level (thus skipping the more verbose "every file" messages
	  from ecma-provider.cs & error-provider.cs).
	* provider.cs: Change Node.CompareTo() to use a "natural sorting"
	  algorithm -- this allows the C# Language Specification nodes to
	  continue being displayed in the correct order.

2008-10-21  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Monodoc/provider.cs: 
	  - Fix Node.Sort() so that it doesn't NRE if nodes == null.
	  - Fix Node.CompareTo() so that it can sort Nodes that haven't been
	    loaded yet.
	  - Add "libraries" as an alias for "root", so that .source files can
	    refer to the parent "libraries" (which would allow us to change
	    the location of "libraries" in the future, should we want to).
	  - If a /monodoc/source/@path refers to a nonexistant node, then
	    insert the contents under Various instead of ignoring it.
	  - Sort the top-level nodes.
	  - Sort the `parent` node after inserting children under it.  This
	    allows multiple different .source files to insert nodes under the
	    same parent node and still have the child nodes sorted as most
	    mortals would expect.
	  - Support a //node/@parent attribute, which allows for creating
	    nodes underneath the specified parent node.  This allows multiple
	    different .source files to contribute to the tree and depend upon
	    each other.  Thus, instead of having a single monodoc.xml file
	    that needs to know the entire tree in advance, the entire tree can
	    be spread across multiple .source files and filled at runtime.

2008-10-18  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile $(LIBRARY_PACKAGE): Set to `monodoc`, as we historically
	  have had a monodoc package (and thus should preserve it).

2008-10-17  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile: Distribute monodoc.dll.config.in.

2008-10-17  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile: Generate a monodoc.dll.config (installed by gacutil), so
	  that monodoc.dll can find the documentation sources.

2008-10-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Mono.Documentation/ManifestResourceResolver.cs, 
	  Mono.Documentation/XmlDocUtils.cs: Make types public so that they
	  can be used from ../mdoc/mdoc.exe.

2008-10-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile: Update $(thisdir).

2008-10-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Assmbly/AssemblyInfo.cs: Change location of mono.snk (since the 
	  monodoc directory was moved from mcs/class to mcs/tools).

2008-10-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile: Improve `make clean` support.

2008-10-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile: Add EXTRA_DISTFILES; monodoc.dll should depend upon
	  Makefile (in case the /resource: lines change); shorten the .gif
	  resource names.

2008-10-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Test (svn:ignore): Ignore generated files.
	* Makefile: Add tests for man-provider.

2008-10-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* ChangeLog: Added/Started.
	* Makefile: Added; build monodoc.dll.
