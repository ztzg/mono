	* UpdatePanel.cs: if the writer passed to RenderChildren is not
	derived from ScriptManager.AlternativeHtmlTextWriter, check
	whether its InnerWriter derives from that type and, if yes, use
	it from that point onwards.

	* ScriptManager.cs: always request the webform.js script to be
	present. It may happen that a control during a dynamic update will
	need to call one of the WebForm_* functions and the call will fail
	as the script will be absent.
	If debugging is enabled, send the full exception backtrace in
	WriteCallbackException - helps debugging AJAX errors.

	* UpdatePanel.cs: do not check whether a panel whose children are
	to be rendered has been marked for update in the async postback
	mode. It prevents complex scenarios where there is one superior
	update panel which owns an inferior one, and only the superior one
	has Update called on it.

	* ScriptManager.cs: do not throw NREX when there are no profile or
	authentication service sections in the config files.

	* AsyncPostBackTrigger.cs: don't thrown an exception if EventName
	is null or empty and there is no DefaultEventAttribute attached to
	the control.

	* ScriptComponentDescriptor.cs: do not add the same
	entry twice to a dictionary.
