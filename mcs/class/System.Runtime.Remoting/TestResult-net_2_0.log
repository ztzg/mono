Tests run: 332, Failures: 0, Not run: 4, Time: 91.829 seconds

Tests not run:
1) MonoTests.Remoting.GenericTest.TestTcpChannel : disabled as it got not working by NUnit upgrade to 2.4.8 (applies to .NET too)
2) MonoTests.Remoting.Http.Bug315570.Main : This test somehow keeps http channel registered and then blocks any further http tests working. This also happens under .NET, so this test itself is wrong with nunit 2.4.8.
3) MonoTests.Remoting.Http.Bug324362.Test : This test somehow keeps http channel registered and then blocks any further http tests working. This also happens under .NET, so this test itself is wrong with nunit 2.4.8.
4) MonoTests.Remoting.RemotingServicesTest.ConnectProxyCast : We cannot test RemotingConfiguration.Configure() because it keeps channels registered. If we really need to test it, do it as a standalone case
