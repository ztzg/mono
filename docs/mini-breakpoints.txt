Because it is hard to set a breakpoint into generated code, I suggest
you to use the following trick.

In Mono's sources, at the expected place insert these instructions:

    sh4_die(NULL, &buffer);
    sh4_nop(NULL, &buffer);

Then, tell GDB to not pass the SIGILL signal to the application:

    (gdb) handle SIGILL nopass
    Signal        Stop      Print   Pass to program Description
    SIGILL        Yes       Yes     No              Illegal instruction

When your "diepoint" is hit, the flow is passed into the debugger:

    Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.

    0x29d075de in ?? ()
    (gdb) x/i $pc
    0x29d075de:     ldtlb
    (gdb)
    0x29d075e0:     nop

Then move manually the PC to the next "nop" instruction:

    (gdb) set $pc=$pc+2
